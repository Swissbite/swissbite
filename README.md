## Hi, I'm Dave 👋
I'm a software architect and software engineer at [Unic](https://www.unic.com) in [Switzerland 🇨🇭](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/51701). My current roles at Unic are visible at my [public profile](https://www.unic.com/david-daester).

I grew up with coffee, so I'm very familiar with the **JVM** stack. But do not ask me to programm in Java, I advocate for [**Kotlin**](https://kotlinlang.org/) or [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org/).

I'm in love with functional programming languages. At the moment, I'm teaching myself [**elm**-lang](https://elm-lang.org/)

### Languages I can communicate with you:
1. (Swiss)-German
2. English
3. *Français* (I ask for your indulgence)

### My last projects
- Relaunch [energieschweiz.ch](https://www.energieschweiz.ch), redesign the architetcure to be fully headless, content reusable and static site generated with a lot of services and Tools. https://www.unic.com/de/magazin/experten-blog/2021/headless-energieschweiz
