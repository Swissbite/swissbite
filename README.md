# Hi, I'm Dave üëã
I'm a human, a husband, a dad and on my job a software architect and software engineer at [Unic](https://www.unic.com) in [Switzerland üá®üá≠](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/51701). My current roles at Unic are visible at my [public profile](https://www.unic.com/david-daester).

I grew up with coffee, so I'm very familiar with the **JVM** stack. But do not ask me to programm in Java, I advocate for [**Kotlin**](https://kotlinlang.org/) or [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org/).

I'm in love with functional programming languages. At the moment, I'm teaching myself [**elm**-lang](https://elm-lang.org/). My self-teaching project is (yet another) [**elm-minesweeper**](https://github.com/swissbite/elm-minesweeper)

## Languages I can communicate with you:
1. (Swiss)-German, as my mother tongue.
2. English
3. *Fran√ßais*, parce que je l'ai eu √† l'√©cole et que je l'ai utilis√© √† d'autres occasions. (Je vous demande votre indulgence bienveillante).

## My last projects
- Architecting the MVP of [joblex.ch](https://www.joblex.ch) as a POC for [kfmv](https://www.kfmv.ch/). My roles:
  - Software and solution architect
  - Solution and tooling seeker for edge case issues
    - Ensure (kind of) transactions over service borders and solution providers
    - Cache data until payment has been setteled
    - Ensure caching handling is resilient but cleans itself without ever the need of manual handling
    - Work with outdated communication media (such as email) as data target
- Relaunch [energieschweiz.ch](https://www.energieschweiz.ch), redesign of the architecture to a completely headless, content reusable and statically generated site with many services and tools. My roles:
  - Software and solution architect
  - Content model architect
  - Software engineer and technical lead
  - Author of a [blog post](https://www.unic.com/de/magazin/experten-blog/2021/headless-energieschweiz) about the architecture
- Relaunch of [salz.ch](https://www.salz.ch), designed the headless architecture and guided the team to build a distributed system
  - Solution architect
  - DevOps enabler
  - Kubernetes tamer
  - CI/CD Pipeline creator
  - Automation promoter

An overview of my projects (like it would be on a way to long summary) are available in [projects](/projects.md)

## üí¨ My field of interests
### In the field of software
- Anything about CI/CD in the view of using the systems. I worked with GitLab connected to  Argo CD and (G)KE (helm and kustomize), Team City with Octopus, GitHub and the GitHub Actions world (fly.io, Heroku, etc. pp).
  - On my list: Azure DevOps, JetBrains Space
- All about software architecture, especially how to make it resilient and "simple" by reducing unnecessary complexity
- All about web and technologies and what we can do today with the stack we have
  - Except the details of CSS. I'm unable to write nice and shiny websites by my own. But I can design, write and test your next middleware to collect all data from untrusted and unreliable services to have a solid and up-to-date data set üí∞.
 
#### Prefered programming languages (in alphabetical order)
- Java (only if there are reglementations where I cannot use Kotlin. But this is mostly a üö©)
- JavaScript (for really small stuff and most kind of a one time shooter, or - in some cases - just for the browser without any transpilers / additional libraries, etc)
- Kotlin
- Scala
- TypeScript (for real nodejs applications or real frontend development)

### Personal
- Anything about parenting üòÅ
