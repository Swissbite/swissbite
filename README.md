## Hi, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software architect and software engineer at [Unic](https://www.unic.com) in [Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/51701). My current roles at Unic are visible at my [public profile](https://www.unic.com/david-daester).

I grew up with coffee, so I'm very familiar with the **JVM** stack. But do not ask me to programm in Java, I advocate for [**Kotlin**](https://kotlinlang.org/) or [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org/).

I'm in love with functional programming languages. At the moment, I'm teaching myself [**elm**-lang](https://elm-lang.org/). My self-teaching project is (yet another) [**elm-minesweeper**](https://github.com/swissbite/elm-minesweeper)

### Languages I can communicate with you:
1. (Swiss)-German
2. English
3. *FranÃ§ais* (Je vous demande d'Ãªtre indulgent.)
