### Hi, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software architect and software engineer at [Unic](https://www.unic.com) in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. My current roles at Unic are visible at my [public profile](https://www.unic.com/david-daester)

I grew up with coffee, so I'm very familiar with the JVM stack. But do not ask me to programm in Java, I advocate for [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) or [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
